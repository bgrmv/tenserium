# Tenserium — Project Context for Claude

## What is this

Speed-based interactive trainer for English tenses. Players see a sentence or Russian context description and press F1–F12 to identify the tense as fast as possible. Primary audience: Russian speakers. Primary platform: web desktop (hotkey-first), mobile planned.

## Architecture: FSD + CQRS

Feature-Sliced Design layers (top → bottom, imports go downward only):

```
src/
├── app/        — routing, providers, shell layouts
├── pages/      — thin route-level components
├── widgets/    — self-contained UI blocks (question-card, score-bar, squad-board)
├── features/   — user interactions (answer-input, auth, report-error, daily-share)
├── entities/   — business objects (tense, question, session, user, match, learn)
└── shared/     — ui kit, utils, api client, config, types
```

CQRS via Angular Signal Stores (no NgRx):
- **Commands** — methods that mutate state (`submitAnswer`, `nextQuestion`)
- **Queries** — `computed()` signals that derive read-only views (`currentStreak`, `score`, `isComplete`)

Domain stores: `GameSessionStore`, `UserStore`, `LearnStore`, `MatchStore`, `DailyStore`

---

## Key Domain Facts

- **12 tenses**: 3 time periods × 4 aspects (Simple / Continuous / Perfect / Perfect Continuous)
- **Hotkeys**: F1–F12 mapped to tenses in order; configurable by user
- **Scoring**: base (100 × difficulty) + speed bonus (linear decay) + streak multiplier (cap ×5)
- **Modes**: Normal (open, all tenses) and Rank (gated, matchmaking, squad battles up to 4 players)
- **Squad battle**: all players see the same question simultaneously, answer independently; first correct = most points; wrong = 500ms lock
- **Leagues (CEFR)**: Elementary (A1–A2 / IELTS 3–4 / TOEFL 32–45) → Intermediate (B1–B2 / IELTS 5–7 / TOEFL 46–94) → Advanced (C1–C2 / IELTS 7.5–9 / TOEFL 95–120)
- **Divisions**: CEFR level + Roman numeral sub-division (A1-IV … C2-I) = 24 steps total; soft season reset to bottom sub-div of current CEFR level
- **Display preference**: user picks which score system shows next to division badge (IELTS / TOEFL / Cambridge / none); canonical mapping in `shared/config/cefr.config.ts`; helpers in `shared/lib/cefr.ts`
- **Ticket format by league**: Elementary = 1 sentence / 1 key; Intermediate = 2–3 sentences; Advanced = 4–5-sentence narrative, player submits a key-combo chain (e.g. F1·F3·F5·F1), answered sentences shown as coloured dots separated by ·
- **Combo rule**: combo freezes at the error, all earned combo points kept, −ticketBase deducted for wrong answer, multiplier resets to 1; next correct starts a new combo
- **Bots**: scripted bots fill empty squad slots (accuracy/delay scaled per league)
- **Anonymous play**: progress in localStorage; Rank mode and leaderboards require account
- **Content language**: Russian for prompts and UI (first release); English toggle planned

## Supabase Schema (primary tables)

```
users           — profile, league, rank_tier, rank_points, is_premium, daily_rank_matches
questions       — id, tense_id, type (sentence|context), prompt, difficulty (1|2|3), league
sessions        — id, user_id, mode, score, duration_ms, created_at
session_answers — session_id, question_id, is_correct, response_ms
daily_challenge — date (PK), question_ids[]
error_reports   — id, question_id, user_id, description, created_at
matches         — id, player_ids[], league, state, scores, created_at
match_answers   — match_id, player_id, ticket_idx, sentence_idx, tense_id, is_correct, response_ms, points
feedback        — id, category, description, email, created_at
```

## Storage Strategy

**Browser API first — Supabase in Phase 8.**

All state uses `shared/api/storage.service.ts` — never call `localStorage` directly.
When Phase 8 arrives, swap the implementation; the rest of the code is unchanged.

| Phases | Storage |
|--------|---------|
| 1–7 (CI/CD, Angular, FSD, Game Engine, Onboarding, Learn, Daily) | Browser API (localStorage) |
| 8 (Accounts) | Supabase Auth + DB introduced |
| 9–15 (Rank, Leaderboards, Monetization…) | Supabase fully |

---

## Phase Priority (do not skip ahead)

| # | Phase | Done when |
|---|-------|-----------|
| 1 | CI/CD: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages | PR checks pass, deploy works |
| 2 | Angular 19 → 22 | Zoneless, no zone.js |
| 3 | FSD refactor | Folder structure matches spec above |
| 4 | Game Engine + Normal Mode | Playable end-to-end, mobile-responsive |
| 5 | Onboarding | First-launch demo + 5-question sample |
| 6 | Learn pages (priority tenses: Simple family + Present/Past Continuous + Present Perfect) | 6 tenses have grammar content |
| 7 | Daily Challenge (date-seeded, client-side) | Fixed daily set + share card, no backend |
| 8 | Netlify + Supabase + Auth + Cloud Sync | App deploys on Netlify, DB connected, localStorage migrated |
| 9 | Rank Mode + Squad Battle | Tiers, matchmaking, bots, real-time |
| 10 | Leaderboards + Stats | Global/weekly/friends tabs |
| 11 | Monetization | Stripe, premium flag, ad banners |
| 12 | Text Analysis Mode | NLP highlight + inline explanations |
| 13 | PWA | Service worker, offline learn pages |
| 14 | Visual polish | Color system, micro-animations, timer bar |
| 15 | Sound design | Web Audio API, 7 events, sound packs |
| — | Content track (parallel) | All 12 tenses: 20+10 questions, all learn pages |

## Current State

- Angular 19.1.6 + SSR (Express, port 4000)
- Learn page: **Present Simple only** (full content)
- Home grid: all 12 tense slots (scaffolded, mostly empty)
- Exam page: scaffolded, no game logic
- No backend, no auth, no database connected
- Deployed to GitHub Pages via official `actions/deploy-pages` (Pages source set to GitHub Actions)
- **Phase 1 complete**: CI (`ci.yml` — lint+build on PR) + deploy (`deploy.yml` — push to main) workflows live; ESLint configured with Angular-recommended rules; devcontainer added

---

## Conventions

- No comments unless the WHY is non-obvious
- No NgRx — use Angular Signal Stores only
- Imports strictly follow FSD layer order (lint-enforced)
- Dark theme first
- Russian UI strings in i18n-ready format from day one (even if not wired to i18n yet)
